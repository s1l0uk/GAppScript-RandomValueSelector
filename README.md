# GAppScript-RandomValueSelector
Selects a bunch of values randomly within your sheet to munge together!

For use with a GSheet this script will take columns and pick 1 or more
from each to return to the sheet as required by the user. In this
usecase we create an "Iron Chef" to decide how and what Chefs will be
cooking!

Could have other Applications, who doesn't need a bit of randomness?!
